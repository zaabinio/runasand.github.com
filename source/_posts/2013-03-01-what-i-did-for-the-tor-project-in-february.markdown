### Top 5 things I did this month

 * Started working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle, looked at tools such as [Instruments](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) for OS X, and [Process Monitor](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx), [Regshot](https://code.google.com/p/regshot/), [Process Hacker](http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/), and [Capture BAT](https://www.honeynet.org/node/315) for Windows. I believe I will also have to take differences in drives (solid state drive, hard disk drive, virtual hard disk) into account when doing this analysis. I also added a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on Linux [(#8166)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166) to the list.

 * Started working on an improved version of the [short user manual](https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en) ([#5571](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5571), [#5811](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5811), [#8003](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8003)), but figured I would wait until we have decided if we are going to rename obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy to something that is less technical and easier to pronounce.

 * Updated a number of translations of the [short user manual](https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en) and documented [how the translation process works](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/translation/Introduction).

 * Hired new translators/support assistants and drafted a welcome email with information about the different systems, accounts, escalation process, and so on. I also put together a document explaining [how to work with our support system](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction).

 * Resolved 94 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the [tor-reports email](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-March/000163.html) for the full summary). Thanks to Moritz, again, for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.

### Top 5 things I would like to do next month

 * Continue with a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle.

 * Get our new translators/support assistants started with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/) and [RT](http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/).

 * Decide on a new name for obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy, and update the [short user manual](https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en) and other documentation.

 * Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle ([#7008](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008)).

 * Travel for conferences, meetings, and other events. In March, I will be in London, Copenhagen, Boston, and Washington DC.
