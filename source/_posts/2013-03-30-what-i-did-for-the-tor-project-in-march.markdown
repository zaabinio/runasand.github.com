### Top 5 things I did this month

 * Started on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on Linux ([#8166](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166)).

 * Talked to a few people about organizing Tor talks/trainings in Prague, London, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem. I'm hoping to have dates and details all figured out by the end of April.

 * Sent out a welcome email to our new support assistants, created RT accounts for everyone, set up help-ar@rt.tpo, help-es@rt.tpo, help-fr@rt.tpo, and help-zh@rt.tpo, updated the documentation which explains [how to work with our support system](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction), and created [help.torproject.org](https://help.torproject.org/) ([#8517](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8517)).

 * Attended the [Rethinking censorship](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-March/000178.html) conference in Copenhagen, the Tor developer meeting in Boston, and a [digital security event](http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/29/introduction-to-digital-security-with-the-cij/) in London.

 * Resolved 31 tickets in the Tor help desk system. I will send out a full summary to the [tor-reports](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/) mailing list in a few days.

### Top 4 things I would like to do next month

 * Configure, test, and update [ask.torproject.org](https://ask.torproject.org/), our new Q&A site ([#8603](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8603)), and document the new support workflow ([#8518](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8518)).

 * Finish the forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on Linux, document my findings, and start on either OS X or Windows.

 * Update the Tor Cloud images with new options for *BandwidthRate* and *BandwidthBurst* ([#7849](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7849), [#8193](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8193)), update the step-by-step section on the Tor Cloud website with new screenshots ([#8392](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8392)), and document the contents of the images ([#7848](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7848)). 

 * Visit New York and San Francisco, and attend the [OpenITP Circumvention Tech Summit](http://openitp.org/?q=node/32) in Hong Kong.
