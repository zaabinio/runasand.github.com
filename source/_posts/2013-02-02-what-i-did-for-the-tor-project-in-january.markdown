At the beginning of each month, I send an email to the
[tor-reports](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/)
mailing list describing what I did the previous month. I figured that
re-posting this status update here would be a good way to start my blog.

### Top 4 things I did this month

 * Started working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) [(#7008)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008). Building TBB on OS X was a bit of a challenge [(#7964)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7964) and I also ran into a bug with the Tor Browser crashing whenever I visit certain Flash sites [(#8129)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8129).

 * I interviewed 26 candidates for the [translator/support assistant position(s)](https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-translatorsupport.html.en). All the interviews were done via email and I spent a lot of time reviewing the answers I received. I hope we can move forward and hire support assistants in February.

 * I gave a talk about Tor and the Arab Spring at [HacDC](http://www.hacdc.org/). I met with researchers in DC and listened to talks about privacy, stylometry, analysis of onion routing security, and an evaluation of relay
selection in Tor. I attended a meeting with the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) where Andrew talked about all things Tor. I traveled to London and Istanbul (trip reports will be published on Monday).

 * I resolved 204 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the [tor-reports email](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-February/000148.html) for the full summary). I'd like to thank Moritz for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.

### Top 5 things I would like to do next month:

 * Begin a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X 10.8 [(#6846)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6846) and Windows 7 [(#6845)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6845). I still need to figure out if we are adding Linux to the list (the [sponsor page](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorJ) says yes, but we have no ticket for it).

 * Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle [(#7008)](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008). I should be able to continue with this even if the browser is crashing on certain sites.

 * I have a few Trac tickets related to translations and [the short user manual](https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en). I also want to properly document how the translation process works (from adding a new translation resource to pulling down new or updated translations).

 * Help new translators/support assistants get started with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/) and [RT](http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/). I started writing an [introduction](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction) to the Tor help desk system and should make sure this is complete and up to date.

 * Attend [Shmoocon](http://www.shmoocon.org/) and go on vacation.
