    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/29/introduction-to-digital-security-with-the-cij</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday the 25th of March, the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London organized a free event where journalists could <a href="http://www.tcij.org/events/2013-03-25/introduction-digital-security">learn more about digital security</a>. I was invited to speak about Tor, other speakers covered OTR, TrueCrypt, GPG, and mobile security.</p>

<p>The attendees were divided into five groups, and each speaker had 20-25 minutes with each group. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy">Pluggable Transports Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2012-TorProject-Annual-Report.pdf">2012 annual report</a>.</p>

<p>I talked a bit about the history of Tor and the Tor Project, discussed a few different threats, mentioned hidden services, listed a few examples of real world use, and helped everyone get the Tor Browser Bundle up and running. I did not have access to a projector or whiteboard, so I did my best to illustrate how Tor works by drawing boxes, arrows, blobs, and stick figures on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>A number of people asked if we had some sort of document or manual explaining all the topics covered at this event. I mentioned <a href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a box</a> and the <a href="http://flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>, but also pointed out that there is currently no single document available, that I am aware of, which explains all of these topics.</p>

<p>I have previously discussed creating such a document with the <a href="http://www.rorypecktrust.org/">Rory Peck Trust</a>, which is a London based organization that specialises in safety, security and professional development for freelance journalists. I mentioned this again when I met with them the day after the CIJ event, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the end result in a few months.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tcij.org/">Centre for Investigative Journalism</a> for hosting the event and inviting me.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/28/social-media-online-anonymity-the-arab-spring/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-28T13:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/28/social-media-online-anonymity-the-arab-spring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>NATO first published this post on the WE-NATO blog in July 2012. The
blog appears to be gone now, which is why I am re-publishing the post
here.</em></p>

<h2>Social Media and Online Anonymity during the Arab Spring</h2>

<p>It has been more than a year and a half since demonstrations broke out in central Tunisia at the funeral for Mohamed Bouazizi. Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, set himself on fire in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests sparked by his death spread rapidly throughout Tunisia, and the Arab world soon erupted in revolution. Protests followed in Egypt, Libya, Iran, and Syria, as well as a number of other countries, with strikes, demonstrations, marches and rallies. Social media was also used to organize protests, communicate with other activists, and uncover state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.</p>

<p>In the months that followed the first protests in December 2010, videos, pictures, and stories from activists spread quickly via the Internet. Social media played a central role in the shaping of political debates and has proven a powerful tool for mobilizing support quickly. Social networking sites - such as Facebook and Twitter - allowed the world to stay updated and facilitated ongoing protests. Meanwhile, activists continued using social media as a way to organize protests and spread awareness. That changed, however, when authorities started to censor more and more websites.</p>

<p>Egypt blocked both Facebook and Twitter on January 26, 2011, and other countries in the region followed suit. A day or two later, Egypt completely shut down the Internet, along with the cellphone services in the country.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/egypt2010.png"></p>

<p>Activists looked for ways to circumvent this censorship in order to tell the world about the recent developments. Many users reached out for free proxy servers, VPN services in other countries, and anonymity tools - such as Tor - as means to bypass the blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is a software that allows users all over the world to connect to the Internet anonymously and securely. It is free, open source, and developed and maintained by the Tor Project. Tor prevents anyone watching an Internet connection from learning what sites the users are visiting, and it prevents the sites being visited from learning the users&#8217; real IP address and physical location. The software was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used by a wide variety of people for different purposes.</p>

<p>An estimated <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">500,000 people</a> use Tor on a daily basis, which makes it more than just a tool for activists. Some use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, some use Tor to research sensitive topics, and some use Tor to connect to news sites when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor enables citizen journalists to write about local events to encourage social change, helps human rights activists safely and anonymously report abuses from danger zones, gives abuse victims basic privacy when browsing online, and is recommended for anonymous blogging.</p>

<p>The number of people who use Tor daily has skyrocketed since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Tor has seen an increase in users from around 200,000 in the beginning of 2010 to around 500,000 in the middle of 2012. Users in Iran have increased from 7,000 to 40,000; in Tunisia from 800 to 1,000; in Egypt from 600 to 1,500; in Syria from 600 to 15,000. These numbers suggest that more and more people are concerned about - and aware of - censorship, surveillance, and lack of privacy on the Internet.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/torusers-2010-2012.png"></p>

<p>In addition, research shows that the use of surveillance technology to watch Internet users, censor websites, and block Tor is increasing; new cases have been exposed so far in 2012, with deep packet inspection being deployed and used in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors">China</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-partially-blocks-encrypted-network-traffic">Iran</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/kazakhstan-upgrades-censorship-deep-packet-inspection">Kazakhstan</a>, and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ethiopia-introduces-deep-packet-inspection">Ethiopia</a>. The Tor Project continue to work on making the Tor software both easier to use for people around the world, and harder for authorities to censor and block completely.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/little-printer-auth-bypass/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-01T10:29:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/little-printer-auth-bypass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a>, created by
<a href="http://berglondon.com/">BERG</a>, holds a compact, inkless, thermal
printer and prints messages filled with things like your schedule,
tweets, news headlines and friendsâ€™ birthdays.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/littleprinter.jpg"></p>

<p>The website <a href="http://remote.bergcloud.com/">remote.bergcloud.com</a> is used
to communicate with the Little Printer; set up print subscriptions, send
messages to the printer, give friends permission to send messages, and
so on. I discovered an authentication/authorization bypass issue on this
site which allows an owner of a Little Printer, as well as any user who
has been authorized to print messages to at least one Little Printer, to
print messages to any of the Little Printers out there &#8211; without prior
authorization from the owners.</p>

<p>The HTTP POST which is sent when you message the Little Printer contains
the following payload:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=TOKEN&message%5Bbot_id%5D=ID \
</span><span class='line'>&message%5Bstyle%5D=1&message%5Bmessage%5D=Hello!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The field <strong>message[bot_id]</strong> contains the ID of the Little Printer,
which is a sequential numeric identifier. Changing the ID allows a user
to send a message to another Little Printer without being authorized by
the owner. The user is also able to print messages without
<strong>authenticity_token</strong> present in the payload.</p>

<p>After printing a message, the site will normally display a box saying
<em>Message sent</em>. When printing to another Little Printer, without really
having permission to do so, the site displays an error and it seems like
printing was not successful. However, that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

<p>I reported this issue directly to Nick Ludlam, the CTO at BERG,
yesterday. He replied an hour later saying that the issue had been
patched on the live system. More information about this can be found in
BERG&#8217;s <a href="http://bergcloud.com/2013/03/01/berg-cloud-security-announcement/">security announcement</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/what-i-did-for-the-tor-project-in-february</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Top 5 things I did this month</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Started working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle, looked at tools such as <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Instruments</a> for OS X, and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx">Process Monitor</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/regshot/">Regshot</a>, <a href="http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/">Process Hacker</a>, and <a href="https://www.honeynet.org/node/315">Capture BAT</a> for Windows. I believe I will also have to take differences in drives (solid state drive, hard disk drive, virtual hard disk) into account when doing this analysis. I also added a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on Linux <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166">(#8166)</a> to the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Started working on an improved version of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5571">#5571</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5811">#5811</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8003">#8003</a>), but figured I would wait until we have decided if we are going to rename obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy to something that is less technical and easier to pronounce.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated a number of translations of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> and documented <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/translation/Introduction">how the translation process works</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hired new translators/support assistants and drafted a welcome email with information about the different systems, accounts, escalation process, and so on. I also put together a document explaining <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction">how to work with our support system</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolved 94 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-March/000163.html">tor-reports email</a> for the full summary). Thanks to Moritz, again, for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Top 5 things I would like to do next month</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Continue with a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle.</p></li>
<li><p>Get our new translators/support assistants started with <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/">Transifex</a> and <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on a new name for obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy, and update the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> and other documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">#7008</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Travel for conferences, meetings, and other events. In March, I will be in London, Copenhagen, Boston, and Washington DC.</p></li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Testing Tor Hidden Services with Burp Pro]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/25/testing-tor-hidden-services-with-burp-pro/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-25T09:33:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/25/testing-tor-hidden-services-with-burp-pro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On February 15, Dafydd Stuttard announced the release of <a href="http://releases.portswigger.net/2013/02/v1505.html">Burp Suite v1.5.05</a>. This release contains a number of feature enhancements and bugfixes, including an extension to the SOCKS proxy support which allows users to specify that all DNS lookups should be done remotely via the proxy. This means that it is possible to test Tor hidden services with Burp.</p>

<p>This feature is currently only available in Burp Pro, but should eventually make its way into the free edition.</p>

<h3>Tor hidden services</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">Tor hidden services</a>, sometimes also referred to as the <em>hidden web</em>, <em>dark web</em>, and <em>deep web</em>, were deployed on the Tor network in 2004. Hidden services allow users to host various kinds of resources, such as websites and instant messaging servers, without having their identity or location revealed. Not only does this protect the operators, but also the resources.</p>

<p>A hidden service can only be accessed through its Tor-specific <em>.onion</em> pseudo-<em>top-level domain (TLD)</em>. One example is <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a>, which is the address of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> search engine. The relays in the Tor network understand the .onion pseudo-TLD and route data anonymously both to and from the hidden service. The IP address, physical location, or operator of a Tor hidden service is never revealed to relays in the Tor network, visitors, or the Tor Project &#8211; as long as the hidden service has been properly <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en">configured and secured</a>.</p>

<h3>Tor hidden services and Burp</h3>

<p>To test a Tor hidden service with Burp, make sure the Tor Browser, Tor, and Burp can all talk to each other:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en">verify the signature</a>, and get it up and running</li>
<li>Figure out which SOCKS port the Tor Browser is using to talk to Tor: <em>Preferences</em>, <em>Advanced</em>, <em>Network</em>, <em>Settings</em> (next to <em>Configure how TorBrowser connects to the Internet</em>)</li>
<li>Configure Burp to use the same SOCKS proxy as the Tor Browser: <em>Options</em>, <em>Connections</em>, scroll down to the SOCKS proxy section, enter the host and port, and tick <em>Use SOCKS proxy</em> and <em>Do DNS lookups over SOCKS proxy</em></li>
<li>Configure the Tor Browser to use Burp as an HTTP Proxy: on the proxy settings page, enter <em>127.0.0.1:8080</em> as the HTTP proxy and tick <em>Use this proxy for all server protocols</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Visiting <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a> in the Tor Browser gives the following output in Burp:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/training-journalists-in-istanbul/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-04T09:31:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/training-journalists-in-istanbul</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After meeting with <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/meeting-with-soca-in-london/">SOCA in London</a>, I traveled to Istanbul to teach local and foreign journalists how to use Tor and Tails to keep themselves, their colleagues, and their sources safe online. I also met with the team behind <a href="http://zerodaydoc.com/">Zero Day</a>, a documentary about all things Internet security, to talk about Tor and the work that I do.</p>

<p>I met with foreign journalists on the first day and local journalists the day after. Around 30 people attended in total, and each training session lasted just over two hours. <a href="http://encrypted.cc/2013-01-28-istanbul.pdf">My presentation</a> covered threats, how you can protect your communication, local data, and external data, as well as how to use the Tor Browser Bundle and Tails. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">the short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php">CPJ Journalist Security Guide</a>. PC users were also given USB sticks with <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>The feedback has been really positive from everyone who attended, and I have been told that those who were unable to attend have been given the material I handed out. There are some things that can be improved, however:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tor does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from
learning that you&#8217;re using Tor. In some cases, the fact that you are
using Tor and encrypting emails/chat/drives can be a red flag. I am
not sure how to best address this in a presentation, other than just
say that yes, it can be a red flag.</p></li>
<li><p>We talked about a few different risks, such as having your phone
tapped, your email hacked, and your home or hotel room broken into.
Having solid examples and stories helps a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>I introduced a lot of new technology in a short amount of time. Those who are not familiar with technology such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption">full disk encryption</a>, <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>, and <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a>, would benefit from a longer and more hands-on session.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation included screenshots of encrypted email, encrypted
chat, and the Tor Browser Bundle. Having a few videos that illustrate
how it works, what the user sees, and what the new workflow is will
make it easier to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitlocker">Bitlocker</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault">FileVault</a>, and <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> for full disk encryption, but did not go into details. I told everyone how to enable FileVault in OS X, and I should add these step-by-step instructions to the presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. We also receive funding via U.S. government organizations. I covered this briefly in my presentation, but could have spent a bit more time talking about the Tor Project, Inc and why we are qualified to talk about Internet security and online anonymity.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Tails</h3>

<p>I asked a few people to try out Tails and let me know if something was
confusing, did not work, or could be improved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tails has <a href="https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html#index1h2">very limited support</a> for Apple hardware. 23 out of 30 attendees were Mac users. I tried booting Tails on my MacBook Air, but OS X was unable to find the USB stick.</p></li>
<li><p>I am used to the Tor Browser and was surprised to see that <a href="https://check.torproject.org">check.torproject.org</a> was not the default home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox will start automatically once you are connected to the
Internet. Most users did not wait for the Tails website to load
before entering another URL in the address bar. Users did not
question if they were actually using Tor.</p></li>
<li><p>One user waited for the Tails website to load, saw the green download
button and then asked if he needed to upgrade to a newer version. I
wonder if there is a way to let users know which version they are
currently using.</p></li>
<li><p>A few users seemed confused when Pidgin automatically connected to
IRC. I wonder if it would be better to have that disabled by default,
and instead take users through the process of setting up their own
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>One user tried the email client, skipped the part where you set up
the mail servers, and tried to write an email. I wonder if there is a
way to improve this, as most users expect the mail client to work
just like the one they are used to in their normal operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>Tails uses a US keyboard layout by default. This can be confusing for
anyone with a different keyboard layout. A few users mentioned that
the tap-touchpad-to-click functionality did not work.</p></li>
<li><p>One user pointed out that there is no logout or shutdown option
available when using Tails in Windows XP mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The shutdown process can look a bit scary for anyone who is not used
to Linux, especially the part where it wipes the memory. A friendly
splash-screen of some sort would be good.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks to my wonderful hosts for providing me with a place to stay,
great food, suggestions on what to see in Istanbul, and for organizing
and hosting the training sessions.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-04T09:16:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/meeting-with-soca-in-london</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January I met with the <a href="http://www.soca.gov.uk/">Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA)</a> in London, UK. One of the challenges when dealing with online threats (cybercrime/e-crime) is understanding which leads not to follow. My goal was to help them understand what Tor is, how it works (both from a user and a relay operator point of view), and what it can and cannot do.</p>

<p>I talked about the Tor software ecosystem, including <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html">ExoneraTor</a> (the website that tells you whether a given IP address was a Tor relay), and mentioned that we list all <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en">official projects</a> on our website. I also mentioned Roger&#8217;s trip to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-october-fbi-conference">FBI conference</a> in October 2012, and talked about some of the experiences we have had teaching US-based law enforcement about Tor.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say the meeting went well. They learned more about Tor and the projects we are working on, and they are aware that the protections that prevent us from figuring out what Tor users are doing - and who they are - is what&#8217;s keeping all Tor users safe.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Started working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a> <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">(#7008)</a>. Building TBB on OS X was a bit of a challenge <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7964">(#7964)</a> and I also ran into a bug with the Tor Browser crashing whenever I visit certain Flash sites <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8129">(#8129)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I interviewed 26 candidates for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-translatorsupport.html.en">translator/support assistant position(s)</a>. All the interviews were done via email and I spent a lot of time reviewing the answers I received. I hope we can move forward and hire support assistants in February.</p></li>
<li><p>I gave a talk about Tor and the Arab Spring at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org/">HacDC</a>. I met with researchers in DC and listened to talks about privacy, stylometry, analysis of onion routing security, and an evaluation of relay
selection in Tor. I attended a meeting with the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) where Andrew talked about all things Tor. I traveled to London and Istanbul (trip reports will be published on Monday).</p></li>
<li><p>I resolved 204 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-February/000148.html">tor-reports email</a> for the full summary). I&#8217;d like to thank Moritz for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.</p></li>

<h3>Top 5 things I would like to do next month:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Begin a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X 10.8 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6846">(#6846)</a> and Windows 7 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6845">(#6845)</a>. I still need to figure out if we are adding Linux to the list (the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorJ">sponsor page</a> says yes, but we have no ticket for it).</p></li>
<li><p>Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">(#7008)</a>. I should be able to continue with this even if the browser is crashing on certain sites.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a few Trac tickets related to translations and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">the short user manual</a>. I also want to properly document how the translation process works (from adding a new translation resource to pulling down new or updated translations).</p></li>
<li><p>Help new translators/support assistants get started with <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/">Transifex</a> and <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>. I started writing an <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction">introduction</a> to the Tor help desk system and should make sure this is complete and up to date.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org/">Shmoocon</a> and go on vacation.</p></li>
</ul>
