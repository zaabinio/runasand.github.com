    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/05/20/forensic-analysis-of-tor-on-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of a deliverable for two Tor Project sponsors (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorJ">Sponsor J</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorL">Sponsor L</a>), I have been working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle. In this three part series, I will summarize the most interesting or significant traces left behind after using the bundle, deleting it, and then shutting down the computer. Part one <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/04/12/forensic-analysis-of-tor-on-linux/">covered</a> Debian Linux (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166">#8166</a>), this part will cover Windows 7 (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6845">#6845</a>), and part three will cover OS X 10.8 (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6846">#6846</a>).</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>I set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of Windows 7, logged in
with the default admin account, installed available updates, and shut it
down cleanly. I connected the virtual drive to another virtual machine,
used <em>hashdeep</em> to compute hashes for every file on the drive, and then
<em>rsync</em> to copy all the files over to an external drive.</p>

<p>After having secured a copy of the clean virtual machine, I rebooted the
system, connected an external drive, and copied the Tor Browser Bundle
(version 2.3.25-6, 64-bit) from the external drive to the <em>Desktop</em>. I
extracted the package archive by clicking on the file, then started the
Tor Browser Bundle by going into the <em>Tor Browser</em> folder and clicking
on <em>Start Tor Browser.exe</em>.</p>

<p>Once the Tor Browser was up and running, I browsed to a few pages, read
a few paragraphs here and there, clicked on a few links, and then shut
it down by closing the Tor Browser and clicking on the <em>Exit</em>-button in
Vidalia. The Tor Browser did not crash and I did not see any error
messages. I deleted the Tor Browser folder and the package archive by
moving the folder and the archive into the <em>Recycle Bin</em>, right-clicking
on it and choosing <em>Empty Recycle Bin</em>.</p>

<p>I repeated the steps with hashdeep and rsync to create a copy of
the tainted virtual machine. I also used
<a href="http://www.thebaskins.com/main/component/content/article/15-work/60-noriben-your-personal-portable-malware-sandbox">Noriben</a>,
written by Brian Baskin, to create a report of everything the Tor
Browser Bundle did while it was running.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Using hashdeep, I compared the hashes from the tainted virtual machine
against the hashes from the clean virtual machine: <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/files/windows_changed_files.txt">256 files</a>
have hashes that do not match any of the hashes in the clean set.
Additionally, the <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/files/noriben.txt">Noriben output</a>
shows the Tor Browser Bundle create, edit, and remove a bunch of files.</p>

<p>I have sorted the most interesting findings into different groups,
depending on the location, how they were created, and so on.
Windows 7 has <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ak841sy.aspx#isolated_storage_locations">built-in symbolic links</a>
designed for backward compatibility, which is why Noriben and hashdeep
list the same files in different locations.</p>

<h4>Prefetch</h4>

<p>Windows keeps track of the way the system starts and which programs the
user commonly opens. This information is saved as a number of small
files in the prefetch folder:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Windows\Prefetch\START TOR BROWSER.EXE-F5557FAC.pf</li>
<li>C:\Windows\Prefetch\TBB-FIREFOX.EXE-350502C5.pf</li>
<li>C:\Windows\Prefetch\TOR-BROWSER-2.3.25-6_EN-US.EX-1354A499.pf</li>
<li>C:\Windows\Prefetch\TOR.EXE-D7159D93.pf</li>
<li>C:\Windows\Prefetch\VIDALIA.EXE-5167E0BC.pf</li>
</ul>


<p>The following cache files are most likely similar to prefetch files and
might contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\cversions.1.db</li>
<li>C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches{AFBF9F1A-8EE8-4C77-AF34-C647E37CA0D9}.1.ver0x0000000000000006.db</li>
<li>C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\RecentFileCache.bcf</li>
</ul>


<p>I have created <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8916">#8916</a> for this issue.</p>

<h4>SetupAPI</h4>

<p>SetupAPI and the Plug and Play (PnP) manager write entries to
<em>SetupAPI.dev.log</em> and <em>SetupAPI.app.log</em> about operations that install
devices and drivers. The following files contain information about the
attached external drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log</li>
<li>C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\usbstor.inf_amd64_ neutral_0725c2806a159a9d\usbstor.PNF</li>
</ul>


<h4>Thumbnail Cache</h4>

<p>Windows stores thumbnails of graphics files, and certain document and
movie files, in Thumbnail Cache files. The following files contain the
Onion Logo icon associated with the Tor Browser Bundle:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_32.db</li>
<li>C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_96.db</li>
<li>C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_256.db</li>
</ul>


<p>Other Thumbnail Cache files, such as <em>thumbcache_1024.db</em>,
<em>thumbcache_sr.db</em>, <em>thumbcache_idx.db</em>, and <em>IconCache.db</em>, may also
contain the Onion Logo icon. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8921">#8921</a> for this issue.</p>

<h4>Windows Defender</h4>

<p>Windows Defender is the default anti-virus software on Windows 7.
Windows Defender will write log files to the following location:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support\</li>
</ul>


<p>The log files will contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle if Windows
Defender ever decides to flag it as malware. This is true for any
anti-virus software.</p>

<h4>Windows Error Reporting (WER)</h4>

<p>Windows Error Reporting (WER) captures and logs information about
software crashes and other issues. I found information about the
attached external drive in the following file:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\NonCritical_x64_ 84cd279a5e83221bfa7edcb36665592c1974e4_cab_0b21673a/DMI671B.tmp.log.xml</li>
</ul>


<p>The logs will probably contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle if any
part of the bundle, such as the Tor Browser or Vidalia, ever hangs or
crashes.</p>

<h4>Windows Event Log</h4>

<p>The following two event logs contain information about the attached
external drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Application.evtx</li>
<li>C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\System.evtx</li>
</ul>


<h4>Windows Paging File</h4>

<p>Microsoft Windows uses a paging file, called <em>pagefile.sys</em>, to store
frames of memory that do not currently fit into physical memory. The
file <em>C:\pagefile.sys</em> contains information about the attached external
drive, as well as the filename for the Tor Browser Bundle executable. I
have created <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8918">#8918</a> for this issue.</p>

<h4>Windows Registry</h4>

<p>The Windows Registry is a databse that stores various configuration
settings and options for the operating system. <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</em>,
abbreviated <em>HKCU</em>, stores settings that are specific to the currently
logged-in user. Each user&#8217;s settings are stored in files called
<em>NTUSER.DAT</em> and <em>UsrClass.dat</em>.</p>

<p>The path to the Tor Browser Bundle executable is listed in the following
two files:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat</li>
<li>C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat.LOG1</li>
</ul>


<p>I did not find traces of the Tor Browser Bundle in any of the
<em>NTUSER.DAT</em> files. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8919">#8919</a> for
this issue.</p>

<p>Additionally, the output from Noriben indicates that the Tor Browser
Bundle touches the registry by creating keys and setting values. The
following value points to the Tor Browser Bundle executable on the
attached external drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Set Value] Explorer.EXE:1196 > HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache\E:\tor-browser-2.3.25-6_en-US.exe  =  7z SFX</li>
</ul>


<p>The output also makes it look like the Tor Browser Bundle adds the following keys and values:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Set Value] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\MuiCache\11\52C64B7E\LanguageList  =  en-US, en</li>
<li>[CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}</li>
<li>[CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count</li>
<li>[CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}</li>
<li>[CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}\Count</li>
</ul>


<p>I found that these keys and values are present on a clean Windows 7 system
where the Tor Browser Bundle has never been used. I also downloaded and tested
the German version of the Tor Browser Bundle to make sure that the
<em>LanguageList</em> value does not represent the language of the Tor Browser Bundle.</p>

<h4>Windows Search</h4>

<p>Windows Search, which is enabled by default, builds a full-text index of
files on the computer. One component of Windows Search is the Indexer,
which crawls the file system on initial setup, and then listens for file
system notifications to index changed files. Windows Search writes a number of
files to the following location:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\</li>
</ul>


<p>I have not found a way to read the Windows Search database files, but I
would say it is likely that Windows Search picked up the Tor Browser
Bundle at some point. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8920">#8920</a> for this issue.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-12T22:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/04/12/forensic-analysis-of-tor-on-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of a deliverable for two of our sponsors (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorJ">Sponsor J</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorL">Sponsor L</a>), I have been working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle. In this three part series, I will summarize the most interesting or significant traces left behind after using the bundle. This post will cover Debian Linux (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166">#8166</a>), part two will cover Windows 7, and part three will cover OS X 10.8.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>I set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of Debian 6.0 Squeeze,
logged in once and shut it down cleanly. I then connected the virtual
drive to another virtual machine and used <em>dd</em> to create an image of the
drive. I also used <em>hashdeep</em> to compute hashes for every file on the
drive, and <em>rsync</em> to copy all the files over to an external drive.</p>

<p>After having secured a copy of the clean virtual machine, I rebooted the
system, connected an external drive, and copied the Tor Browser Bundle
(version 2.3.25-6, 64-bit) from the external drive to my Debian home
directory. I extracted the package archive and started the Tor Browser
Bundle by running <em>./start-tor-browser</em> inside the Tor Browser directory.</p>

<p>Once the Tor Browser was up and running, I browsed to a few pages, read
a few paragraphs here and there, clicked on a few links, and then shut
it down by closing the Tor Browser and clicking on the <em>Exit</em>-button in
Vidalia. The Tor Browser did not crash and I did not see any error
messages. I deleted the Tor Browser directory and the tarball using
<em>rm -rf</em>.</p>

<p>I repeated the steps with <em>dd</em>, <em>hashdeep</em>, and <em>rsync</em> to create a copy of
the tainted virtual machine.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Using <em>hashdeep</em>, I compared the hashes from the tainted virtual machine
against the hashes from the clean virtual machine: <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/files/debian_changed_files.txt">68 files</a>
had a hash that did not match any of the hashes in the clean set. The
most interesting files are:</p>

<p><strong>~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/home</strong>: contains the filename of
the Tor Browser Bundle tarball:
<em>tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-5-dev-en-US.tar.gz</em>. GVFS is the
virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop, so this result will probably
vary depending on the window manager used. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8695">#8695</a> for this issue.</p>

<p><strong>~/.xsession-errors</strong>: contains the following string: <em>&#8220;Window
manager warning: Buggy client sent a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message with a
timestamp of 0 for 0x3800089 (Tor Browse)&#8221;</em>. It is worth noting that a
file named <em>.xsession-errors.old</em> could also exist. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8696">#8696</a> for this issue.</p>

<p><strong>~/.bash_history</strong>: contains a record of commands typed into
the terminal. I started the Tor Browser Bundle from the command line, so
this file contains lines such as <em>./start-tor-browser</em>. I have created
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8697">#8697</a> for this
issue.</p>

<p><strong>/var/log/daemon.log</strong>, <strong>/var/log/syslog</strong>, <strong>/var/log/kern.log</strong>,
<strong>/var/log/messages</strong>: contains information about attached devices. I
had an external drive attached to the virtual machine, so these files
contain lines such as <em>&#8220;Mounted /dev/sdb1 (Read-Write, label &#8220;THA&#8221;, NTFS
3.1)&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Initializing USB Mass Storage driver&#8230;&#8221;</em>.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-29T10:40:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/29/introduction-to-digital-security-with-the-cij</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday the 25th of March, the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London organized a free event where journalists could <a href="http://www.tcij.org/events/2013-03-25/introduction-digital-security">learn more about digital security</a>. I was invited to speak about Tor, other speakers covered OTR, TrueCrypt, GPG, and mobile security.</p>

<p>The attendees were divided into five groups, and each speaker had 20-25 minutes with each group. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy">Pluggable Transports Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2012-TorProject-Annual-Report.pdf">2012 annual report</a>.</p>

<p>I talked a bit about the history of Tor and the Tor Project, discussed a few different threats, mentioned hidden services, listed a few examples of real world use, and helped everyone get the Tor Browser Bundle up and running. I did not have access to a projector or whiteboard, so I did my best to illustrate how Tor works by drawing boxes, arrows, blobs, and stick figures on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>A number of people asked if we had some sort of document or manual explaining all the topics covered at this event. I mentioned <a href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a box</a> and the <a href="http://flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>, but also pointed out that there is currently no single document available, that I am aware of, which explains all of these topics.</p>

<p>I have previously discussed creating such a document with the <a href="http://www.rorypecktrust.org/">Rory Peck Trust</a>, which is a London based organization that specializes in safety, security and professional development for freelance journalists. I mentioned this again when I met with them the day after the CIJ event, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the end result in a few months.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tcij.org/">Centre for Investigative Journalism</a> for hosting the event and inviting me.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-28T13:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/28/social-media-online-anonymity-the-arab-spring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>NATO first published this post on the WE-NATO blog in July 2012. The
blog appears to be gone now, which is why I am re-publishing the post
here.</em></p>

<h3>Social Media and Online Anonymity during the Arab Spring</h3>

<p>It has been more than a year and a half since demonstrations broke out in central Tunisia at the funeral for Mohamed Bouazizi. Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, set himself on fire in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests sparked by his death spread rapidly throughout Tunisia, and the Arab world soon erupted in revolution. Protests followed in Egypt, Libya, Iran, and Syria, as well as a number of other countries, with strikes, demonstrations, marches and rallies. Social media was also used to organize protests, communicate with other activists, and uncover state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.</p>

<p>In the months that followed the first protests in December 2010, videos, pictures, and stories from activists spread quickly via the Internet. Social media played a central role in the shaping of political debates and has proven a powerful tool for mobilizing support quickly. Social networking sites - such as Facebook and Twitter - allowed the world to stay updated and facilitated ongoing protests. Meanwhile, activists continued using social media as a way to organize protests and spread awareness. That changed, however, when authorities started to censor more and more websites.</p>

<p>Egypt blocked both Facebook and Twitter on January 26, 2011, and other countries in the region followed suit. A day or two later, Egypt completely shut down the Internet, along with the cellphone services in the country.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/egypt2010.png"></p>

<p>Activists looked for ways to circumvent this censorship in order to tell the world about the recent developments. Many users reached out for free proxy servers, VPN services in other countries, and anonymity tools - such as Tor - as means to bypass the blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is a software that allows users all over the world to connect to the Internet anonymously and securely. It is free, open source, and developed and maintained by the Tor Project. Tor prevents anyone watching an Internet connection from learning what sites the users are visiting, and it prevents the sites being visited from learning the users&#8217; real IP address and physical location. The software was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used by a wide variety of people for different purposes.</p>

<p>An estimated <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">500,000 people</a> use Tor on a daily basis, which makes it more than just a tool for activists. Some use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, some use Tor to research sensitive topics, and some use Tor to connect to news sites when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor enables citizen journalists to write about local events to encourage social change, helps human rights activists safely and anonymously report abuses from danger zones, gives abuse victims basic privacy when browsing online, and is recommended for anonymous blogging.</p>

<p>The number of people who use Tor daily has skyrocketed since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Tor has seen an increase in users from around 200,000 in the beginning of 2010 to around 500,000 in the middle of 2012. Users in Iran have increased from 7,000 to 40,000; in Tunisia from 800 to 1,000; in Egypt from 600 to 1,500; in Syria from 600 to 15,000. These numbers suggest that more and more people are concerned about - and aware of - censorship, surveillance, and lack of privacy on the Internet.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/torusers-2010-2012.png"></p>

<p>In addition, research shows that the use of surveillance technology to watch Internet users, censor websites, and block Tor is increasing; new cases have been exposed so far in 2012, with deep packet inspection being deployed and used in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors">China</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-partially-blocks-encrypted-network-traffic">Iran</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/kazakhstan-upgrades-censorship-deep-packet-inspection">Kazakhstan</a>, and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ethiopia-introduces-deep-packet-inspection">Ethiopia</a>. The Tor Project continue to work on making the Tor software both easier to use for people around the world, and harder for authorities to censor and block completely.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/little-printer-auth-bypass/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-01T10:29:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/little-printer-auth-bypass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a>, created by
<a href="http://berglondon.com/">BERG</a>, holds a compact, inkless, thermal
printer and prints messages filled with things like your schedule,
tweets, news headlines and friends’ birthdays.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.encrypted.cc/images/littleprinter.jpg"></p>

<p>The website <a href="http://remote.bergcloud.com/">remote.bergcloud.com</a> is used
to communicate with the Little Printer; set up print subscriptions, send
messages to the printer, give friends permission to send messages, and
so on. I discovered an authentication/authorization bypass issue on this
site which allows an owner of a Little Printer, as well as any user who
has been authorized to print messages to at least one Little Printer, to
print messages to any of the Little Printers out there &#8211; without prior
authorization from the owners.</p>

<p>The HTTP POST which is sent when you message the Little Printer contains
the following payload:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=TOKEN&message%5Bbot_id%5D=ID \
</span><span class='line'>&message%5Bstyle%5D=1&message%5Bmessage%5D=Hello!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The field <strong>message[bot_id]</strong> contains the ID of the Little Printer,
which is a sequential numeric identifier. Changing the ID allows a user
to send a message to another Little Printer without being authorized by
the owner. The user is also able to print messages without
<strong>authenticity_token</strong> present in the payload.</p>

<p>After printing a message, the site will normally display a box saying
<em>Message sent</em>. When printing to another Little Printer, without really
having permission to do so, the site displays an error and it seems like
printing was not successful. However, that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

<p>I reported this issue directly to Nick Ludlam, the CTO at BERG,
yesterday. He replied an hour later saying that the issue had been
patched on the live system. More information about this can be found in
BERG&#8217;s <a href="http://bergcloud.com/2013/03/01/berg-cloud-security-announcement/">security announcement</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/03/01/what-i-did-for-the-tor-project-in-february</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Top 5 things I did this month</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Started working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle, looked at tools such as <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Instruments</a> for OS X, and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx">Process Monitor</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/regshot/">Regshot</a>, <a href="http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/">Process Hacker</a>, and <a href="https://www.honeynet.org/node/315">Capture BAT</a> for Windows. I believe I will also have to take differences in drives (solid state drive, hard disk drive, virtual hard disk) into account when doing this analysis. I also added a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on Linux <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166">(#8166)</a> to the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Started working on an improved version of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5571">#5571</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5811">#5811</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8003">#8003</a>), but figured I would wait until we have decided if we are going to rename obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy to something that is less technical and easier to pronounce.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated a number of translations of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> and documented <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/translation/Introduction">how the translation process works</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hired new translators/support assistants and drafted a welcome email with information about the different systems, accounts, escalation process, and so on. I also put together a document explaining <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/support/Introduction">how to work with our support system</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolved 94 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-March/000163.html">tor-reports email</a> for the full summary). Thanks to Moritz, again, for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Top 5 things I would like to do next month</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Continue with a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle.</p></li>
<li><p>Get our new translators/support assistants started with <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/">Transifex</a> and <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on a new name for obfsproxy/pyobfsproxy, and update the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">short user manual</a> and other documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">#7008</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Travel for conferences, meetings, and other events. In March, I will be in London, Copenhagen, Boston, and Washington DC.</p></li>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/25/testing-tor-hidden-services-with-burp-pro/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-25T09:33:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/25/testing-tor-hidden-services-with-burp-pro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On February 15, Dafydd Stuttard announced the release of <a href="http://releases.portswigger.net/2013/02/v1505.html">Burp Suite v1.5.05</a>. This release contains a number of feature enhancements and bugfixes, including an extension to the SOCKS proxy support which allows users to specify that all DNS lookups should be done remotely via the proxy. This means that it is possible to test Tor hidden services with Burp.</p>

<p>This feature is currently only available in Burp Pro, but should eventually make its way into the free edition.</p>

<h3>Tor hidden services</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">Tor hidden services</a>, sometimes also referred to as the <em>hidden web</em>, <em>dark web</em>, and <em>deep web</em>, were deployed on the Tor network in 2004. Hidden services allow users to host various kinds of resources, such as websites and instant messaging servers, without having their identity or location revealed. Not only does this protect the operators, but also the resources.</p>

<p>A hidden service can only be accessed through its Tor-specific <em>.onion</em> pseudo-<em>top-level domain (TLD)</em>. One example is <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a>, which is the address of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> search engine. The relays in the Tor network understand the .onion pseudo-TLD and route data anonymously both to and from the hidden service. The IP address, physical location, or operator of a Tor hidden service is never revealed to relays in the Tor network, visitors, or the Tor Project &#8211; as long as the hidden service has been properly <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en">configured and secured</a>.</p>

<h3>Tor hidden services and Burp</h3>

<p>To test a Tor hidden service with Burp, make sure the Tor Browser, Tor, and Burp can all talk to each other:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en">verify the signature</a>, and get it up and running</li>
<li>Figure out which SOCKS port the Tor Browser is using to talk to Tor: <em>Preferences</em>, <em>Advanced</em>, <em>Network</em>, <em>Settings</em> (next to <em>Configure how TorBrowser connects to the Internet</em>)</li>
<li>Configure Burp to use the same SOCKS proxy as the Tor Browser: <em>Options</em>, <em>Connections</em>, scroll down to the SOCKS proxy section, enter the host and port, and tick <em>Use SOCKS proxy</em> and <em>Do DNS lookups over SOCKS proxy</em></li>
<li>Configure the Tor Browser to use Burp as an HTTP Proxy: on the proxy settings page, enter <em>127.0.0.1:8080</em> as the HTTP proxy and tick <em>Use this proxy for all server protocols</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Visiting <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a> in the Tor Browser gives the following output in Burp:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/training-journalists-in-istanbul/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-04T09:31:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/training-journalists-in-istanbul</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After meeting with <a href="http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/meeting-with-soca-in-london/">SOCA in London</a>, I traveled to Istanbul to teach local and foreign journalists how to use Tor and Tails to keep themselves, their colleagues, and their sources safe online. I also met with the team behind <a href="http://zerodaydoc.com/">Zero Day</a>, a documentary about all things Internet security, to talk about Tor and the work that I do.</p>

<p>I met with foreign journalists on the first day and local journalists the day after. Around 30 people attended in total, and each training session lasted just over two hours. <a href="http://encrypted.cc/2013-01-28-istanbul.pdf">My presentation</a> covered threats, how you can protect your communication, local data, and external data, as well as how to use the Tor Browser Bundle and Tails. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">the short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php">CPJ Journalist Security Guide</a>. PC users were also given USB sticks with <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>The feedback has been really positive from everyone who attended, and I have been told that those who were unable to attend have been given the material I handed out. There are some things that can be improved, however:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tor does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from
learning that you&#8217;re using Tor. In some cases, the fact that you are
using Tor and encrypting emails/chat/drives can be a red flag. I am
not sure how to best address this in a presentation, other than just
say that yes, it can be a red flag.</p></li>
<li><p>We talked about a few different risks, such as having your phone
tapped, your email hacked, and your home or hotel room broken into.
Having solid examples and stories helps a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>I introduced a lot of new technology in a short amount of time. Those who are not familiar with technology such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption">full disk encryption</a>, <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>, and <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a>, would benefit from a longer and more hands-on session.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation included screenshots of encrypted email, encrypted
chat, and the Tor Browser Bundle. Having a few videos that illustrate
how it works, what the user sees, and what the new workflow is will
make it easier to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitlocker">Bitlocker</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault">FileVault</a>, and <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> for full disk encryption, but did not go into details. I told everyone how to enable FileVault in OS X, and I should add these step-by-step instructions to the presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. We also receive funding via U.S. government organizations. I covered this briefly in my presentation, but could have spent a bit more time talking about the Tor Project, Inc and why we are qualified to talk about Internet security and online anonymity.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Tails</h3>

<p>I asked a few people to try out Tails and let me know if something was
confusing, did not work, or could be improved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tails has <a href="https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html#index1h2">very limited support</a> for Apple hardware. 23 out of 30 attendees were Mac users. I tried booting Tails on my MacBook Air, but OS X was unable to find the USB stick.</p></li>
<li><p>I am used to the Tor Browser and was surprised to see that <a href="https://check.torproject.org">check.torproject.org</a> was not the default home page.</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox will start automatically once you are connected to the
Internet. Most users did not wait for the Tails website to load
before entering another URL in the address bar. Users did not
question if they were actually using Tor.</p></li>
<li><p>One user waited for the Tails website to load, saw the green download
button and then asked if he needed to upgrade to a newer version. I
wonder if there is a way to let users know which version they are
currently using.</p></li>
<li><p>A few users seemed confused when Pidgin automatically connected to
IRC. I wonder if it would be better to have that disabled by default,
and instead take users through the process of setting up their own
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>One user tried the email client, skipped the part where you set up
the mail servers, and tried to write an email. I wonder if there is a
way to improve this, as most users expect the mail client to work
just like the one they are used to in their normal operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>Tails uses a US keyboard layout by default. This can be confusing for
anyone with a different keyboard layout. A few users mentioned that
the tap-touchpad-to-click functionality did not work.</p></li>
<li><p>One user pointed out that there is no logout or shutdown option
available when using Tails in Windows XP mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The shutdown process can look a bit scary for anyone who is not used
to Linux, especially the part where it wipes the memory. A friendly
splash-screen of some sort would be good.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks to my wonderful hosts for providing me with a place to stay,
great food, suggestions on what to see in Istanbul, and for organizing
and hosting the training sessions.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-04T09:16:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.encrypted.cc/blog/2013/02/04/meeting-with-soca-in-london</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January I met with the <a href="http://www.soca.gov.uk/">Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA)</a> in London, UK. One of the challenges when dealing with online threats (cybercrime/e-crime) is understanding which leads not to follow. My goal was to help them understand what Tor is, how it works (both from a user and a relay operator point of view), and what it can and cannot do.</p>

<p>I talked about the Tor software ecosystem, including <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html">ExoneraTor</a> (the website that tells you whether a given IP address was a Tor relay), and mentioned that we list all <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en">official projects</a> on our website. I also mentioned Roger&#8217;s trip to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-october-fbi-conference">FBI conference</a> in October 2012, and talked about some of the experiences we have had teaching US-based law enforcement about Tor.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say the meeting went well. They learned more about Tor and the projects we are working on, and they are aware that the protections that prevent us from figuring out what Tor users are doing - and who they are - is what&#8217;s keeping all Tor users safe.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of each month, I send an email to the
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/">tor-reports</a>
mailing list describing what I did the previous month. I figured that
re-posting this status update here would be a good way to start my blog.</p>

<h3>Top 4 things I did this month</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Started working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a> <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">(#7008)</a>. Building TBB on OS X was a bit of a challenge <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7964">(#7964)</a> and I also ran into a bug with the Tor Browser crashing whenever I visit certain Flash sites <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8129">(#8129)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I interviewed 26 candidates for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-translatorsupport.html.en">translator/support assistant position(s)</a>. All the interviews were done via email and I spent a lot of time reviewing the answers I received. I hope we can move forward and hire support assistants in February.</p></li>
<li><p>I gave a talk about Tor and the Arab Spring at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org/">HacDC</a>. I met with researchers in DC and listened to talks about privacy, stylometry, analysis of onion routing security, and an evaluation of relay
selection in Tor. I attended a meeting with the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) where Andrew talked about all things Tor. I traveled to London and Istanbul (trip reports will be published on Monday).</p></li>
<li><p>I resolved 204 tickets in the Tor help desk system (see the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-February/000148.html">tor-reports email</a> for the full summary). I&#8217;d like to thank Moritz for taking care of the help desk while I was traveling.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Top 5 things I would like to do next month:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Begin a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X 10.8 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6846">(#6846)</a> and Windows 7 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6845">(#6845)</a>. I still need to figure out if we are adding Linux to the list (the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorJ">sponsor page</a> says yes, but we have no ticket for it).</p></li>
<li><p>Continue working on an OS X Flash sandbox for the Tor Browser Bundle <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008">(#7008)</a>. I should be able to continue with this even if the browser is crashing on certain sites.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a few Trac tickets related to translations and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/short-user-manual.html.en">the short user manual</a>.
