<h2>Social Media and Online Anonymity during the Arab Spring</h2>

<p>It has been more than a year and a half since demonstrations broke out in central Tunisia at the funeral for Mohamed Bouazizi. Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, set himself on fire in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests sparked by his death spread rapidly throughout Tunisia, and the Arab world soon erupted in revolution. Protests followed in Egypt, Libya, Iran, and Syria, as well as a number of other countries, with strikes, demonstrations, marches and rallies. Social media was also used to organize protests, communicate with other activists, and uncover state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.</p>

<p>In the months that followed the first protests in December 2010, videos, pictures, and stories from activists spread quickly via the Internet. Social media played a central role in the shaping of political debates and has proven a powerful tool for mobilizing support quickly. Social networking sites - such as Facebook and Twitter - allowed the world to stay updated and facilitated ongoing protests. Meanwhile, activists continued using social media as a way to organize protests and spread awareness. That changed, however, when authorities started to censor more and more websites.</p>

<p>Egypt blocked both Facebook and Twitter on January 26, 2011, and other countries in the region followed suit. A day or two later, Egypt completely shut down the Internet, along with the cellphone services in the country.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/egypt2010.png"></p>

<p>Activists looked for ways to circumvent this censorship in order to tell the world about the recent developments. Many users reached out for free proxy servers, VPN services in other countries, and anonymity tools - such as Tor - as means to bypass the blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is a software that allows users all over the world to connect to the Internet anonymously and securely. It is free, open source, and developed and maintained by the Tor Project. Tor prevents anyone watching an Internet connection from learning what sites the users are visiting, and it prevents the sites being visited from learning the users&#8217; real IP address and physical location. The software was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used by a wide variety of people for different purposes.</p>

<p>An estimated <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">500,000 people</a> use Tor on a daily basis, which makes it more than just a tool for activists. Some use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, some use Tor to research sensitive topics, and some use Tor to connect to news sites when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor enables citizen journalists to write about local events to encourage social change, helps human rights activists safely and anonymously report abuses from danger zones, gives abuse victims basic privacy when browsing online, and is recommended for anonymous blogging.</p>

<p>The number of people who use Tor daily has skyrocketed since the beginning of the Arab Spring. Tor has seen an increase in users from around 200,000 in the beginning of 2010 to around 500,000 in the middle of 2012. Users in Iran have increased from 7,000 to 40,000; in Tunisia from 800 to 1,000; in Egypt from 600 to 1,500; in Syria from 600 to 15,000. These numbers suggest that more and more people are concerned about - and aware of - censorship, surveillance, and lack of privacy on the Internet.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/torusers-2010-2012.png"></p>

<p>In addition, research shows that the use of surveillance technology to watch Internet users, censor websites, and block Tor is increasing; new cases have been exposed so far in 2012, with deep packet inspection being deployed and used in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors">China</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-partially-blocks-encrypted-network-traffic">Iran</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/kazakhstan-upgrades-censorship-deep-packet-inspection">Kazakhstan</a>, and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ethiopia-introduces-deep-packet-inspection">Ethiopia</a>. The Tor Project continue to work on making the Tor software both easier to use for people around the world, and harder for authorities to censor and block completely.</p>
